>>## SS 12.3.2 For Duets – for each competitor the result shall be obtained 
			according to [SS 12.2]. These results shall be added and divided by two (2) 
			to find the average score (round off to the fourth decimal places).
>>## SS 12.3.3 For Teams – for each competitor who swims a team routine 
			the result shall be obtained according to [SS 12.2]. 
			These results shall be added and the total divided by 
			the number of competitors on the team to find out the average score
			(round off to the fourth decimal places).
>>## SS 12.3.4 If a competitor after the preliminaries in Duet
		or Team is not able to swim figures (due to illness or injury),
		in Duet the figure score of the reserve is used to determine 
		the total score for the duet: in Team, 
		the higher figure score of the two reserves is used to 
		determine the total score for the team.
