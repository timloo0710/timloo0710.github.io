	# SS 10.2 If a judge by reason of illness or other unforeseen circumstances has made no award for any one figure, the average of the awards of the other five (5) or six (6) judges

SS 11 PENALTIES IN FIGURE SESSION
---------------------------------

	# SS 11.1 A two (2) point penalty shall be deducted (see SS 12.2).
		## SS 11.1.1 A competitor stops voluntarily and requests to

SS 12 CALCULATION OF THE FIGURE RESULT
----------------------------------------

	# SS 12.1 The highest and the lowest awards are cancelled (one of each). 
		The four (4) or five (5) awards are added, 
		the sum divided by four (4) or five (5). 
		The result is multiplied by the degree of difficulty, 
		to obtain the score for each of the four figures.
	# SS 12.2 The sum of the four figures shall be divided 
		by the total of the degree of difficulty of the group and multiplied by 10, 
		and then the penalties shall be deducted.
	# SS 12.3 The figure result shall be:
		## SS 12.3.1 For Solo the result shall be obtained according to SS 12.2.
		## SS 12.3.2 For Duets – for each competitor the result shall be obtained 
			according to SS 12.2. These results shall be added and divided by two (2) 
			to find the average score (round off to the fourth decimal places).
		## SS 12.3.3 For Teams – for each competitor who swims a team routine 
			the result shall be obtained according to SS 12.2. These results shall be added and the total divided by the number of competitors on the team to find out the average score (round off to the fourth decimal places).
		## SS 12.3.4 If a competitor after the preliminaries in Duet or Team is not able to swim figures (due to illness or injury), in Duet the figure score of the reserve is used to determine the total score for the duet: in Team, the higher figure score of the two reserves is used to determine the total score for the team.

    # SS 17.3.3 Third panel – ELEMENTS Score - 40%
        * Consider:
            EXECUTION – the level of excellence in performing highly specialised skills. Execution of each required element with an assigned degree of difficulty.

    # SS 17.4 In the Technical Routine, if a judge on the Element Panel by reason of unforeseen circumstances has made no award for a particular element (a zero) the referee will review the official video. If the element has been executed, then the average of the awards of the other four judges shall be computed and shall be considered as the missing award. This shall be calculated to the nearest 0.1 point.
